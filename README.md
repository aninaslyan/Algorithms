# Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems or performing tasks. In computer science and mathematics, algorithms are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and automate reasoning.

Types of Algorithms:

- **Cipher**
    * **Caesar** - shifts the letters in the plaintext by a fixed number.
    * **Character Frequency** - uses the frequency of characters in the plaintext to encrypt it.
    * **Distributed Secret** - uses a secret key to encrypt the plaintext.
    * **Playfair** - uses a 5x5 grid of letters to encrypt the plaintext.
    * **Simple Replacement** - replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter.
    * **Hamming Code** (with UI) - detects and corrects errors in the transmitted data.
- **Search**
    * **Linear** - `O(n)` - iterates through each element in the array from the start to the end.
    * **Binary** - `O(log n)` - searches for an element in a _sorted array_ by dividing the array in half at each step.
- **Sort**
    * **Selection** - `O(n^2)` - selects the smallest (or biggest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first (or last) unsorted element.
    * **Insertion** - `O(n^2)` - builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing each element with the rest of the array.
    * **Bubble** - `O(n^2)` - compares each element with the next one and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    * **Quick** - `O(n log n)` - divides the array into two subarrays and sorts them recursively.
    * **Merge** - `O(n log n)` - divides the array into two subarrays and merges them recursively.
