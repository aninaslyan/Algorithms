# Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems or performing tasks. In computer science and mathematics, algorithms are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and automate reasoning.

Types of Algorithms:

- Cipher
    * **Caesar**
    * **Character Frequency**
    * **Distributed Secret**
    * **Playfair**
    * **Simple Replacement**
    * **Hamming Code** (with UI)
- Search
    * **Linear** - `O(n)` - iterates through each element in the array from the start to the end.
    * **Binary** - `O(log n)` - searches for an element in a sorted array by dividing the array in half at each step.
- Sort
    * **Selection**
    * **Insertion**
    * **Bubble**
    * **Quick**
    * **Merge**
